# News Magazine

## Required

-The mongodb compass required to start the application

## Tasks

1. Create a fancy, catchy landing page for new users - and new users only! Make sure it is responsive. Make some part of it reusable as a loading mask.
    - When the page opens for the first time in a browser - and only for the first time(!) - the user is redirected to a landing page.
    - The page is fancy on all devices chrome can simulate
    - The page contains at least one component that is also used on the wall as a loading mask.

2. Use newsAPI to get the latest tech news. Get an API key, and make sure the user always gets the latest news. Beware the API key's limits and the data usage.
    - The app uses an API key from environment variables, and uses it to fetch the news.
    - NewsAPI is not fetched for every request, but still, fresh news are served.


## How to start

- First of all npm start in the backend folder from the terminal

- Then npm start in the frontend folder
